#' @title Most common stratum calculator
#'
#' @description
#' For each cell in the user-defined "coarse grid" used to select
#' spatially-representative samples (i.e. when \code{cfg_sample_spatial ==
#' TRUE}), this function calculates the stratum that occurs most often within
#' each course grid cell.
#'
#' @param rast \code{data.table} object. This \code{data.table} where each cell
#'    that lies within a larger grid cell is represented as a row. For each row,
#'    the variable  \code{grid_id} is the ID of the cell from the coarser grid,
#'    \code{sampled} denotes whether a cell has been sampled,  \code{stratum}
#'    defines the stratum each cell lies within, and  \code{raster_index} is a
#'    unique value for each cell in the raster.
#'
#' @return Vector of values representing the stratum that occurs most often
#'   within a given subset of the raster.
#'
#' @export
gs_mode <- function(rast) {
  ux <- unique(rast)
  return(ux[which.max(tabulate(match(rast, ux)))])
