Description: Multi-stage cluster household surveys are commonly performed by 
	governments and programs to monitor population demographic, social, 
	economic, and health outcomes. In these surveys, communities are sampled 
	in a first  stage of sampling from within subpopulations of interest 
	(or strata), households are sampled in a second stage of sampling, and 
	sometimes individuals are listed and further sampled within households. 
	The first stage of sampling, where communities of sample populations are 
	defined, are called Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) while the households 
	are secondary sampling units (SSUs). Census data are typically used to 
	select PSUs within strata. If census data are outdated, inaccurate, or 
	not available at fine enough scale, however, gridded population data can 
	be used instead. This tool selects PSUs within user-defined strata using 
	gridded population data, given desired numbers of sampled households 
	within each PSU. The population densities used to create PSUs are drawn 
	from rasters such as the population data from the WorldPop Project 
	(http://www.worldpop.org.uk). PSUs are defined within a stratum using a 
	serpentine sampling method, and can be set to have a certain ratio of 
	urban and rural PSUs, or to be evenly distributed across a coarse, 
	user-defined grid.
