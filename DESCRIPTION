Description: Multi-stage cluster surveys of households are commonly performed by 
	governments and programmes to monitor population-level demographic, social, 
	economic, and health outcomes. Generally, communities are sampled from 
	subpopulations (strata) in a first stage, and then households are listed and 
	sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled communities 
	are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the Secondary Sampling 
	Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample frame from which PSUs 
	are selected. However, if census data are outdated inaccurate, or too 
	geographically course, gridded population data (such as <http://www.worldpop.org.uk>) 
	can be used as a sample frame instead. GridSample generates PSUs from gridded 
	population data according to user-specified complex survey design characteristics 
	and household sample size. In gridded population sampling, like census sampling, 
	PSUs are selected within each stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can 
	be oversampled in urban or rural areas to ensure a minimum sample size in each of 
	these important sub-domains. Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size 
	and shape, gridded population sampling allows for samples to be representative of
	both the population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.
